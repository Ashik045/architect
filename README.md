Architect is an architectural company-based application.

Architect is an architectural company-based application.
Architect company provides their services by this application. People can see what kind of services Architect company provide. If anyone convinces of the designs they can call or contact with Architect company by email. Through this website, they provide their past work experiences. And people can get an idea by reading the blog section of this website.

I'm using SASS for the design pattern. For the front-end validation, I'm using client-side validation without any library. And for the back-end, I'm using Nodejs, Expressjs and MongoDB for the database.  

This website is fully responsive. Every page is pixel-perfect.
